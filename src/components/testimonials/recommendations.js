        Brandon is incredibly skilled at making data-driven decisions to create the best possible experience for the user. He consistently puts the user first, balancing data analytics with real user feedback to ensure each decision in the product roadmap is rooted in evidence. Brandon is also a very strong communicator and leader. He is able to simplify complex vision into very clear, actionable direction that aligns everyone around him.

        Above all, Brandon leads with passion and loyalty. As an engineer on his team, Brandon fosters an environment where people feel supported and driven to do their best work. Any company would be lucky to have him driving their product vision forward!`,

    text: `Working with Brandon at Cut+Dry was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. As Product Lead, he had a clear and compelling vision for the platformâ€™s direction; one that inspired confidence and consistently resulted in products our customers truly valued.

Under his leadership, there was never a day I felt bored or disconnected from the work. Every feature we built was exciting, meaningful, and a step toward solving hard problems that had long gone unanswered in our space. His approach made it easy to trust that following his lead would take us to the right product outcomes.

Brandon had a rare ability to turn complex product and business challenges into solutions that were both highly usable and strategically impactful. From tools that made our platform more valuable to all stakeholders, to initiatives that brought key partners deeper into our ecosystem, his work consistently elevated the product and strengthened its position in the market.

I always believed in his ability to create user-friendly, feature-rich products, and time and again, he delivered. Brandon is a leader with vision, execution, and the kind of energy that makes you look forward to the next day. Iâ€™d gladly build alongside him again any time.`,

    text: `I had the privilege of working with Brandon for just over a 1 year on the Influence team at Cut+Dry. From the beginning, he created an environment where engineers could consistently do their best work by balancing trust and autonomy with a clear vision and strategic context. His leadership style empowered me to take ownership of high-impact initiatives, knowing I had his full support and guidance when navigating challenges.

Under his direction, I successfully led several major initiatives, making data collection and transfer and engaging brands and distributors in a flywheel possible. Brandonâ€™s ability to align stakeholders, set clear priorities, and proactively remove roadblocks ensured these projects were delivered on time and achieved measurable business impact.

His rare combination of technical understanding and leadership capability truly sets Brandon apart. He is more than just a product manager because his profound grasp of technical concepts allows him to provide precise, actionable feedback, accelerating problem-solving and improving outcomes. His leadership is always results-driven and outcome-focused, yet never at the expense of team morale or collaboration. Brandon stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the team during challenges, ensuring we move forward together.

Iâ€™m genuinely sad that Brandon departed Cut+Dry just as Iâ€™m about to release a major platform improvement. He made it possible in the first place and showed me why it was so important for us to move forward. 

Beyond product delivery, Brandon has been a thoughtful mentor, regularly checking in on my professional growth and overall well-being. His feedback was always constructive, specific, and actionable, which helped me develop as an engineer, problem-solver, and collaborator. Brandonâ€™s mix of strategic thinking, technical expertise, and people-first leadership makes him an exceptional leader with whom I would be eager to work again.`,

As his PMM counterpart, I appreciated how easy he made collaboration - we always had great discussions about strategy and next steps, and he has a gift for breaking down complex concepts and sharing the technical details behind product decisions, which made my job significantly easier.

Brandon is incredibly smart and strategic, always keeping everyone informed on his progress. He amazed me leading two major projects - our AI tool development and expanding the manufacturer side of the business. He thinks deeply about the "why" and "how" behind every decision, then executes quickly and effectively. His ability to move from strategic thinking to fast implementation is really impressive.

Brandon is the kind of product manager who makes cross-functional work actually enjoyable - I'd jump at the chance to work with him again!`,

I have known Brandon since 2012 when he was a student in my Grade 10 Academic English class.  He has always been determined to improve his skills and to produce high quality work on any task assigned to him. Brandon especially excelled with group projects where he frequently took a leadership role.

Brandonâ€™s leadership skills were also used when he became involved with Student Council as a grade representative and project manager for our spirit clothing campaign.  He independently contacted various vendors to find the best quality product with the best price for our students. Brandon also worked on advertising the sales campaign, coordinated the product orders, and worked on distribution.  His support on all of Student Council activities was enthusiastic and contagious. 

It is very easy to speak highly of this young man.  He is respectful, hardworking, enthusiastic, cooperative, kind, creative and innovative. He takes instruction well, learns quickly, takes responsibility for projects and follows through. 

If you wish to speak to me directly, please contact me at the numbers or email given below.  Brandon is an exceptional student and will do well in any task he is given. I look forward to hearing of his future successes.

Although the opportunity to personally meet Brandon was not available, those in my organization shared nothing less than positive words on his behalf.

Brandon demonstrated a high level of organization on a regular basis while tracking various tasks simultaneously. He often supported the creation and enrollment of a large system to better our Financial processes. In doing so, Brandon demonstrated he champions learning and development opportunities while he functioned to achieve success with other employees in order to progress the project. It was evident Brandon believed that no work was menial as he worked diligently to complete any task. While supporting the project and other various tasks Brandon worked well independently, however, he never hesitated to reach out for support when required.

During the duration of his co-op, Brandon further worked independently on behalf of Supply Chain's Warehouse Management division in order to bring our Compressed Gas Storage Facility up to a higher standard. He frequently demonstrated a relentless pursuit for excellence by always pushing the completion of tasks, and going beyond the call of duty in the interest and safety of himself, other employees, and the company. Although Brandon will not see the completion of this project during his term, the momentum he has put into the mission will drive the project to completion and in the future lead by example.

I recommend Brandon without reservation to any future endeavours as I believe he has the capabilities to strive in many environments.`,

The objective of this program is to provide promising students an opportunity to explore potential career scenarios, to gain experience working within a large corporation and to expand an appreciation of the discipline and work ethic required in a full time employment position.

During his time at Bruce Power Brandon has demonstrated initiative, team work, and patience while being assigned various activities within both organizations. In particular he distinguished himself in supporting the Supply Chain Warehouse team in reorganizing the Compressed Gas Storage area to become more streamlined and efficient.

His safety conscious drive, determination and high standards coupled to an uncompromising vision of excellence were noted by all who work with him on this project. The work he accomplished will provide a model for other on site compressed gas storage locations.

As an individual Brandon proved reliable and exceptionally responsible, regularly volunteering to jump in and support any task. While working in Finance he demonstrated an ability to multi-task, balancing various activities without dropping any balls. Key to Brandon's success is his strong communication skills, his willingness to ask questions while communicating progress, problems and potential delays with many on-going events. Brandon is an intelligent personable young man who was well liked by all in the workplace.

I am convinced that Brandon possesses the skills and traits to be an asset to any future employers and to allow him to succeed in any endeavour he choose to apply himself to.`,
