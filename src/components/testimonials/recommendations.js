            immediate need. He has the rare ability to manage multiple projects at once, handle customer relationships with ease, and 
            keep the team motivated through open communication and a people-first approach. As an engineering lead, I found it incredibly
            easy and rewarding to work with him—we spent countless hours collaborating closely, bridging the gaps between vision and
            implementation, and fostering a strong product-first culture together.

            Beyond his professional strengths, Brandon is also someone I genuinely enjoyed working with on a personal level. 
            Our conversations, both about work and beyond, were always meaningful and enjoyable, and over time he became a good friend.
            I would love the opportunity to work with him again and recommend him wholeheartedly as a product leader who elevates
            both the product and the people around him.`,

    text: `I’ve been lucky enough to get to work closely with Brandon for nearly 3 years... [We] teamed up on product content, 
            eCommerce, manufacturer marketing, search, GPO strategy... [He] is the single most prolific and productive talent 
            I have worked with in over 30 years of data strategy & development. Looked at in a different way, I’ve never known a colleague
            with such relentless detail focus to also possess such a first-rate strategic intellect; nor have I ever known a top-tier 
            strategist that could instantly jump into the muck and emerge with a fully-wrought service, app or feature set.
            These are two ends of a wide spectrum, and it is Brandon’s essential gift.\n\n

            Brandon was charged with developing a “Manufacturer Portal” to attract the participation– and revenue– of [brands], 
            from small independents to the giant Conagra’s and Smucker’s of the industry. Not a lot of detail or even 
            ideas how to do it. Brandon planned and executed a long series of ‘discovery sessions’ with all types of manufacturers, 
            which enabled him to suss out demand and design a series of services attractive to this market. He then lobbied internally 
            for the resources to build it all, was promised 2/3 of what he needed, was actually delivered only 1/3 of the original ask…
            and yet 2 years later, over a thousand industry brand-owners now engage the Portal regularly, and many of those have now graduated 
            to full paying clients.\n\n

            When Cut+Dry landed its largest strategic deal to date, signing a long-term financing, distribution and co-marketing deal with a 
            multi-billion-dollar industry player, the entire project was assigned to him, again with paltry resources and little in the way 
            of specifics. It required deep data synchronization, elegant UI look and functionality, heavy reporting & analytics, and the 
            always complicated delivery of real-time transaction integration... It took over 6 months of work at every
            level to bring to market, yet what emerged is a well-built, highly functional and innately profitable eCommerce sub-system that 
            will be contributing to Cut+Dry’s revenues for years to come. I’ve had the honor of writing dozens of [recommendations]
            in my long career. It just turned out that this one is the most laudatory of all.
